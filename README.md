# abarbanell.github.io -> http://blog.abarbanell.de

This is the git repository driving the github pages at
[blog.abarbaell.de](https://blog.abarbanell.de). The technology
used is Jekyll-Bootstrap, with my own theme.

The theme is separately available at
[abarbanell/theme-tobias](https://github.com/abarbanell/theme-tobias), it
is a fork from the well-known theme
[jekyllbootstrap/theme-tom](https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-tom).
There are graphical changes to the original theme, but also the
introduction of SASS for the css files.

Below is the original intro to Jekyll-Bootstrap modified to keep a
reminder for myself about the most relevant commands

## Jekyll-Bootstrap

The quickest way to start and publish your Jekyll powered blog. 100% compatible with GitHub pages

## Usage

For all usage and documentation please see: <http://jekyllbootstrap.com>

Some frequently used commands: 

Create a new post with: 

```
$ rake post title="Hello World"
```


## Version

0.3.0 - stable and versioned using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

**NOTE:** 0.3.0 introduces a new theme which is not backwards compatible in the sense it won't _look_ like the old version.
However, the actual API has not changed at all.
You might want to run 0.3.0 in a branch to make sure you are ok with the theme design changes.

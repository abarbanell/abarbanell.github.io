# Intro

In this article I would like to go into some experiences of applying SCRUM
in a corporate environment which is dominated by PRINCE2. I assume some
knowledge of  PRINCE2 and SCRUM, because it would be beyond the scope
of this blog to give a primer on both. You can find some introductory
material on PRINCE2 here: 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRINCE2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRINCE2)
and on SCRUM here:

# Technical aspects

There are a lot of points where PRINCE2 and SCRUM can be joined.

First, both put a high emphasis on making sure the project delivers
business value – In Prince2 in the form of a business case, in SCRUM
each Sprint planning meeting is going through the business value of
each requirement / feature / story and thus aligns business benefits
with the project costs.

Second, Prince2 mandates a certain structure for the project from a
macro level, but leaves it optional that some teams within the project
can operate under a different process. The only requirement is that
for each “work package” the team manager agrees delivery plan,
acceptance critertria and tolerances with the overall project manager. In
most cases these tolerances are expressed in schedule or cost, but for
a SCRUM team it is more logical to express the tolerance in terms of
scope. Thus you could use the Sprint backlog from the Sprint planning
meeting as a PRINCE2 work package.

In a big project it could well be that one subteam is using SCRUM for
software development, while other subteams (e.g. server procurement,
network setup,  user training,  marketing) might not use SCRUM at all.

PRINCE2 is having a small part of adaptive planning in the idea of having
project stages, and doing detailed planning only for the next stage. These
stages could be mapped to either SCRUM sprints or to milestones. Typically
a PRINCE2 project stage would be longer than a SCRUM sprint, but this
depends on your setup.

I would see the best approach to work with an agile team in a
PRINCE2 project is this approach of encapsulation: SCRUM is used on
the development team level, PRINCE2 is used at the macro level, the
adaptive planning of SCRUM is reflected in the stage plan of PRINCE2 and
the tolerance for each work package. Each sprint backlog is seen as a
workpackage for the PRINCE2 project. The Scrum Master is mapped to the
PRINCE2 team  manager role, responsible for the outside communication
from the development team to the project manager. The Business Owner for
the Product backlog is either the senior user from the PRINCE2 project
board or a delegate of the senior user.

# Cultural aspects

It is a fact that SCRUM and PRINCE2 come from different angles and
traditionally PRINCE2 is definitely not an agile method. The different
mindsets of forward planning vs. adaptive planning will clash at some
points, even if technically the two approaches can be integrated.

With some level of understanding on both sides this can be turned
into a workable solution, the PRINCE2 framework is flexible enough for
integrating an agile development team, but most PRINCE2 project managers
may not be adaptive enough to deal with this situation.

# Summary

Whether it is a desirable setup or not, if you are working for a client
who has adopted PRINCE 2 or your own company runs projects according to
PRINCE 2, it is still possible to create an agile environment for the
development team and reap the benefits of SCRUM by encapsulating SCRUM
within PRINCE 2.

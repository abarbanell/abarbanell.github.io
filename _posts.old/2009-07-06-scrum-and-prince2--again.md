I found a [slideshow]
(http://www.slideshare.net/jenshoffmann/integrating-scrum-with-classical-project-management)
 on integrating scrum with classical project
management which is much more elaborate than 
my post a few weeks ago – looks interesting.

Although I must admit that I was fitting these two processses together to
embed my project better in the surrounding culture, not so much because
I believe that it is a fundamentally great thing. After all, adding two
processes together will only make things more difficult at first. It is
an interesting option mainly when you are constrained in your choice of
processes like in my case, I had to manage it as a Prince2 project on
the macro level whether I wanted or not.

Encapsulating SCRUM for the micro level allowed me at least to choose some
agile practices for the devlopment team while the project manager could
take care of the Prince2 representation of the project at the board level.

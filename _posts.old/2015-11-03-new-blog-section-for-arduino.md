I have created a new section in this blog with articles focused around Arduino and general Internet-of-Things
topics. There will be coverage of different Arduino projects, different boards and especially the 
[wino-board](http://www.wino-board.com), a small Arduino board with integrated WiFi.

There will be tips and tricks and articles at [http://blog.abarbanell.de/arduino-wino](http://blog.abarbanell.de/arduino-wino) and related code on [github](https://github.com/abarbanell/arduino-wino).

The first [post](http://blog.abarbanell.de/arduino-wino/wino/arduino/2015/10/31/Arduino-Wino-Reset.html)
 is about how to wire up a Reset button for the wino board:

I hope you enjoy it.

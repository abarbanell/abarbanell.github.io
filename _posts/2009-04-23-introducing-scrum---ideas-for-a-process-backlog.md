title: "Introducing SCRUM - ideas for a process backlog"

In a recent project, I had to bootstrap a SCRUM environment – so the
question is where do you start? One way of course is to get everybody on
a SCRUM training, then setting up some infrastructure, and then start. I
had this luxury at a previous company in pre-SCRUM era, but this time
a more agile approach was needed. We had a project pipeline which was
more than full and had to deliver while in transition towards SCRUM. So
the idea was to introduce SCRUM  incrementally – after all this is
what SCRUM is about.

So, what can you actually achieve in terms of implementing SCRUM in
your first sprint if the situation is not in your favour? You have a
distributed team? Command and Control culture? Not one product manager
but a board of 15 with no single shared view? And maybe more…

Well, it is not realistic to do everything at the start. And also,
you will need some success stories along the way to sell the idea
both internally in the team and outside to management and other
stakeholders. One way is to look at short term benefits with each single
change. Starts to sound like the devlopment of the product itself. So
why not  build your “process backlog” to prioritize and schedule.

## The process backlog

On this “process backlog” you could put all SCRUM practices like
creating a product backlog, using timeboxed sprints, having daily scrum
meetings, etc. And you could also add supporting practices like setting
up a continuous integration environment, among others. Some of these
may be from the XP world, but it really depends on your situation.

Then you pick items from this list for implementation in the upcoming
sprint. As soon as the sprint retrospective is implemented (may be at
the end of sprint 1) this is a natural place to look at process items
to pick and implement.

## Story 1: timeboxed sprints

The easiest sell in my experience was the concept of a timeboxed sprint
– it gives the customer the assurance of a timeline and the price
(possible de-scoping) is not so visible at first. There will be fights
about this later towards end of the sprint, but it is still reasonably
easy to sell the idea.  If you must, you just implement monthly project
reviews and go through the agenda for the end of Sprint demo without
telling too much theory. Once they start to like this idea you tell them
what SCRUM says about it. (Actually this is another great idea I got
from Henrik Knibergs great book [Scrum and XP from the Trenches]
(http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/%20scrum-xp-from-the-trenches)
and I wish I had known this earlier)

## Story 2: daily scrum

Also, the daily scrum meeting was a point at the start. In the beginning
it did not feel like a “self organizing team”, more like traditional
top-down micromanagement. Still better than no communication at all,
but geographical distribution and cultural gaps in the team have made
it difficult to get to a more collaborative approach quickly. So the
meeting had to be done on the phone actually because we wanted to
keep the ceremony low. Just thinking of getting everybody into a video
conferencing room (and booking this rooms in both facilities in advance)
was not something I wanted to tackle in the first sprint.

## Story 3: sprint backlog

Then there was the sprint backlog – in its almost simplest form of
an excel spreadsheet. A real task board was not the right start for us
because the team was in different continents. It would be great to have
a better tool support for this but this was out of sope for the first
sprint. I am toying around with Sharepoint wiki’s because it was
available, and this could be a next step. The goal would be to build
more a visual and collaborative experience for all team members to get
them “hooked”.

## Outlook

This was about as much as we achieved in the first sprint – after
all we basically have put this into a team used to less agile ways
of working and we couldn’t invest too much time in process changes,
tools or training.  All of the process investment has to be incremental
over time. The plan would be to address the product owner problem next
and make sure we have one product owner to be a single point of contact,
and this one would need the authority to prioritize and the acessibility
that the team can actually use her as a knowledge source. Once we have
someone to own the product backlog, this needs to be implemented next.

This was the experience from the start, I will later write a followup
to keep you up to date.

Thanks for reading, and I do hope that these ideas are useful.

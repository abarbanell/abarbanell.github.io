There is a very interesting book by David Weinberger I just read for the
second time – it should be for everyone interested how traditional
approaches to searching and classifying knowledge have to be changed
to work in a digital world – I recommend this to people who have to
build any kind of knowledge applications:

[Everything Is Miscellaneous: The Power of the New Digital Disorder]
(http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0805088113?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwabarbanede-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=0805088113)

Some of the interesting observations:

- Any kind of knowledge classification has problems to cope with new
  science and technology – for the single fact that it is new and was
  not thought of when the classification was conceived.  
- Editorial control over content does not scale in a Web 2.0 world unless 
  your editorial capacity is scaled up with the millions of users hitting 
  your site (solution: get a large number of volunteer editors like wikipedia)
- Tagging (e.g. Delicious) scales much better than classification, but it
  actually needs large numbers to be meaningful. Small number of tags are
  just random bits of data without any information. Large numbers of tags
  reveal information which would not be visible in a classical approach.
  Classification also has often problems when something belongs to multiple
  categories. With Tagging this is easy to solve.  
- Tagging is limited when you need hard, reliable, authoritative information 
  about something 

Most important – it is actually fun to read!

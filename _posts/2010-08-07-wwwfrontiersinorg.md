We just brought live the new site of [www.frontiersin.org](http://www.frontiersin.org), which
was my biggest SCRUM project up to now. Here are my first learnings from
this project:

SCRUM helped us (we were client on this project) to see much earlier
were the development team was going, and had regular feedback points at
the SCRUM demos.

However, there was a conflict between the SCRUM tenet of minimal
documentation and our customer requirement to fully document the project
– which was needed for support and knowledge retention purposes,
but also to have an agreed baseline for customer acceptance.

The size of the project (1 year, a peak of 60+ people in 8 teams) was
quite amazing, and being a “remote” customer in a different timezone
did make communication difficult at times.

Splitting out some special teams was also not strictly in line with
SCRUM, but it has worked for us – we have split out a functional
analysis and screen design team, which worked always 1-2 sprints ahead
of the development, and in the end we also split out a separate test
team. Especially the separation of the test team was a violation of the
SCRUM tenet of cross-functional teams, but again: it has worked for us
in this specific environment.

Each of these points would be probably worth a separate article in the
future – let’s see whether I find the time for it.

I would be interested to learn of any experience of other people on
larger SCRUM projects.

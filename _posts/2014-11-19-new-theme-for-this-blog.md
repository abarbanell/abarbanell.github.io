This blog starts to appear in a new look. I have decided to create my own
theme for this, as a starting point I have used the well-known
theme [tom](https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-tom) which I kind
of liked, but after a while I thought it was just a bit TOO simple.

Also, I wanted to play a bit with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and this
looked like a nice little playground.

The new theme is aptly named
[tobias](https://github.com/abarbanell/theme-tobias) and can be freely
downloaded from github.

You will probably see many small changes coming over the next time as I
experiment, and there will be times when different pages are not fully
consistent.

Please bear with me - I am just doing this for fun until I get distracted
by something else.

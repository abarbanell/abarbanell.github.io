# Combat des Reines

A swiss tradition in the spring time is the cow fight, called [combat
des reines](http://www.valais.ch/en/activities/culture-customs/cow-fights)
in Valais.

Aside from the big events up to the yearly national chanpionships,
there are also smaller events in some villages.

While hiking in the Val de Bagnes we came across one of these small
events in Lourtier on 7-May-2016 and although this is not a full
report of the event, I hope this short video gives an impressions.

Please note, nobody was hurt....

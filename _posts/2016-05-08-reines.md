# Combat de Reines

A swiss tradition in the spring time is the cow fight, called [combat
de reines](http://www.valais.ch/en/activities/culture-customs/cow-fights)
in Valais.

Aside from the big events up to the yearly national championships,
there are also smaller events in some villages.

While hiking in the [Val de Bagnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagnes) we came across one of these small
events in Lourtier on 7-May-2016 and although this is not a full
report of the event, I hope this short video gives an impression.

Please note, nobody was hurt....

Recently, I have been playing with Spark notebooks from
[andypetrella/spark-notebook](https://github.com/andypetrella/spark-notebook)
and created a new github repo for my spark notebooks - aptly named
[abarbanell/mysnb](https://github.com/abarbanell/mysnb).

I feel some blog posts coming up soon, so I decided to open a new
project blog at
[blog.abarbanell.com/mysnb](http://blog.abarbanell.de/mysnb/) to
collect tthe related posts. Keep it bookmarked :)

Anyway, if you like it, I would be happy about some stars on github
as well.

Feedback is always welcome, please let me know what you think (in

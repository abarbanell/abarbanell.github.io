I have got a few [esp8266](https://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp8266ex/overview)
controllers and started to play with it. My code is at 
[abarbanell/arduino-esp8266](https://github.com/abarbanell/arduino-esp8266) and I have also 
opened a new blog section here at 
http://blog.abarbanell.de/arduino-esp8266/

Anyway, if you like it, I would be happy about some stars on github
as for [abarbanell/arduino-esp8266](https://github.com/abarbanell/arduino-esp8266).

A friend recently asked me about details for my Continuous Deployment setup 
for small projects. I promised to write him some notes about it - here they are.

# Define the goal

I have tried to set up a process which allows me to prototype quickly, bring up 
a new project online with small effort, but still have a sound framework of 
integration tests, separation of development from staging (or production). 

This is meant for small projects which are typically iterated fast by a small 
team (or just one developer), but coming from a big team development I would not 
feel well without some suporting structure like source control.

The minimum I want to do is: 

- develop locally, run and test my software locally on my laptop
- have a source control system which allows to track changes and branch out 
for trial versions.
- have some testing framework to avoid completely broken versions to go live
- have a deploy to a public url for staging and/or production, with a single 
line command to deploy

# Example: Limitless Garden

My example project is 
[Limitless garden](https://github.com/abarbanell/limitless-garden) - here you can 
see most of this in action.

# start with github

The starting point is creating a [github repository](https://github.com/new) 
and clone it to your working directory. 

```
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-github-name>/<your-repo-name>.git
```

In my case the platform is node.js with Express, so I initialize the project with 

```
$ cd <my-repo-name>
$ express -e .
$ npm install
````

The ```-e```switch in the express is for the ejs template engine, my personal 
favourite.

Now you can develop locally and run your local instance with 

```
$ npm start
```

This will expose your website on http://localhost:3000

Any changes of course are commited as usual with 

````
git add .
git commit 
git push
````

or (if you use Visual Studio Code like me) with the corresponding UI functions for 
git interaction.


# deploy to heroku

to deploy this from git to heroku you can just set up a webhook from your 
github repo to your heroku instance. To do this you should have a heroku account and then open
your [heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and create a new app. It will 
ask you to choose a name or let heroku generate one for you.

![heroku dashboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2016/10/cd-1.png)

Heroku has quite sophisticated setup for deployment pipelines, and there is a free version,
but it is limited to run a few hours a day. Good enough for staging, 
but if you want something always on they will ask you to pay. Lets go for free first.

After you selected your instance name, heroku will ask you to specify some options. To
deploy from your github repo you check teh options below:

![heroku deploy from github]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2016/10/cd-2.png)

Now you should have heroku site which is always updated from your github repo.

You make a change in your code, commit and push the change to the github server, and a few 
moments later you see this new application in your heroku dashboard and can check the details:

![heroku deploy succeeded]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2016/10/cd-3.png)

You can click on the "open app" link and see your application running.

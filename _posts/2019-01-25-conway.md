# Conway's Law

according to this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)
Conway's Law is cited as:

> organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."
> -- M. Conway [How do Committees invent?](http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html)

# Example

I was joining a small team working on an ecommerce marketplace platform. Because they also wanted some marketing pages to go with this, they have integrated a CMS module inside their marketplace. This has lead to a tight coupling of the CMS and the marketplace, which worked for a team of 2-3 people. Conway's law in its most basic manifestation.

As the organization grew, this was creating problems, because the CMS was now tightly integrated and a lot of the assumptions of the marketplace systems were reflected in the CMS module.

A better approach would have been to run this as two separate systems. 

If we had two different teams responsible for the separate concerns of market place and public marketing frontend, then the separation of systems would have come naturally.

Of course this is not the only way to get to the desired system design, but it shows that the organization you set up has an influence on the system design you build.

# What follows out of it

you need to think organization and system design together. While the organization structure is a constraint for the system design (Conway) it can also be used to purposefully set a constraint to influence the system design, or to make a certain system design easier. 

# The reverse Conway's Law

This gets us to the topic of this article: How can we use organization design to drive system design?

> -- Tobias Abarbanell

# How to apply it

Understand which parts of your system you want to be tightly or loosely coupled.

- Keep together what belongs together
- Keep separate what should not outside: 

API and API clients are good candidates to separate
because you want to make sure that the client only 
uses the documented outside of the API, and not any
implementation assumptions it happens to know.

If you build a multipurpose API for Mobile, Web, and
other clients it may be actually helpful to separate
the users of the API from your API in different teams,
which should really communicate over the published API
functionality. This way any "whitebox" knowledge for
the API users can be eliminated and the "multipurpose"
property of the API is easier to achieve.

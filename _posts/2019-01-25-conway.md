# Conway's Law

according to [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)
Conway's Law is cited as:

> organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."

> - M. Conway [How do Committees invent?](http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html)

# Example

Django CMS; because the team is too coupled, 
the solution is too coupled as well.

# What follows out of it

you need to think organization and system design together

# The reverse Conway's Law

> When designing organizations which design systems one should align
> organizations with the desired communication structures of these systems.
> - Tobias Abarbanell

# How to apply it

Understand which parts of your system you want to be tightly or loosely coupled.

Keep together what belongs together

Keep separate what should not outside: 

API and API clients are good candidates to separate
because you want to make sure that the client only 
uses the documented outside of the API, and not any
implementation assumptions it happens to know.
